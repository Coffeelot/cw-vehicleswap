# Vehicle Swaps ðŸš—

Script that maps and does vehicle swaps (like make a Peyote into a Peyote Gasser/Custom). Better discription to come ðŸ‘€
Currently includes one demo spot (located down by Voodoo Place) that does all cars and one that demos a job-related one that only does restomods and off roaders (up in sandy)
The scrip includes a config where all swaps are defined. Wanna do a Futo to a Moster Truck? Just add it! We're planning to add other swaps also, that include illegal jobs where you steal cars and rebuild them with owned ones, that will utalize this script.
